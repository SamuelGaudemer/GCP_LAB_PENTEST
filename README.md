# GCP LAB
   *This lab was designed with the support of the mindmap below and **based on https://gcpgoat.joshuajebaraj.com/** *

- GCP-Goat is intentionally vulnerable GCP environment to learn and practice GCP Security.

- A single scenario covers the main aspects of a realistic pentest of a GCP environment from gaining access as unauthenticated user to privilege escalation & laterla movement. 
 

- Remediations adapted to prevent the presented vulnerabilities are explained in the file /remediations.


## GETTING STARTED 

1 - Create a new project on google cloud platform **named gcp-lab-pentest[-ID]** where ID must be an integer. 

   ![Add new project](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SamuelGaudemer/GCP_LAB_PENTEST/master/newproject.png "Add new project")
   
2 - Activate compute engine api 

3 - git clone https://github.com/SamuelGaudemer/GCP_LAB_PENTEST.git

4 - cd ./GCP_LAB_PENTEST/scenarios/scenario

5 - Deploy the lab

```
$ ./create <SERVICE-ACCOUNT_NAME>
wait for a moment.....
```
with SERVICE-ACCOUNT_NAME between 6 & 36 characters, example : 
```
$ ./create test111
$ ./delete test111
```

6 - To avoid any extra charges and to make sure all resources are deleted, delete the ressources 

```
$ ./delete <SERVICE-ACCOUNT_NAME>
```

7 - then delete the project 
```
$ gcloud projects delete PROJECT_ID
```
